\noindent \textit{Christer Svensson has compiled a list of the keys of all
the Dylan songs featuring a harp on the official albums. Very impressive
work! I haven't double-checked it, but it seems right.}

%\emph{The list was updated March 1, 2003}

\subsubsection*{General remarks}

Below is a list of the harp keys used on Dylan's albums. If the harp
key is the same as the guitar or piano or backing group (this is known
as first position), I'll just write the key name. If he's playing in
second (also known as cross) position, or if the song is in a minor
key and he's playing in fourth position, I'll give you the real
key first and then the harp key, divided by a slash. E.g. \G\ means
the song is in the key of G using a \G~harp. G/\C\ means the song is
in the key of G using a \C~harp in second aka crossed
position. Eminor/\G\ means the song is in the key of Eminor using a
\G~harp in 4th position. Blues players sometimes use 3rd position, \C
harp in the key of D for example. I don't think I've heard Dylan use
3rd position, though.

So you'll use a \G~harp in 2nd position for playing in D if you want a
bluesy sound. Rita May is one example. You can use the \G~harp in
4th position to play in E minor. That's the way he recorded
Sara. Hurricane is also 4th position, A minor on a \C~harp. In
1st position the key note is in holes 1, 4, 7 and 10, all blow
notes. In 2nd position the key note is in hole 2 draw, and holes 3, 6
and 9 blow. In 4th position the key note is in holes 6 and 10, both
draw..


These are the relationships between harp and backing for second and
fourth positions:
%\begin{alltt}
%Harp:    \G Ab \A Bb B \C Db \D Eb \E F F#
%2nd pos: D Eb E F F# G Ab A Bb B C Db
%4th pos: E F F# G Ab A Bb B C Db D Eb
%\end{alltt}
