Known bugs in Seal's output

* Page header in introduction of Freewheelin',
  Another Side, JWH, New Morning, `Dylan', Down in the Groove, 
  Live 66 (i.e., all one-page intros) are broken 
* Obviously 5 Believers has a too large tab
* Intro to Self Portrait is buggy
* Missing images in What can I do for you and Broke down engine
* The design needs a cleanup. We could, for instance: (1) Only use
  `lowercase' small caps, as Bringhurst does, and set the song titles 
  in small caps everywhere, including the in headings.

Misc
