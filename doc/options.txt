Beginning with revision 82, seal-convert has configuration options
that determine certain aspects of the output. Right now these are

  openright    Start new songs on a right (odd, recto) page
  openleft     Start new songs on a left (even, verso) page
  openany      Start new songs on any (the next) page

For instance, you can type
  ./seal-convert -o openleft /usr/local/doc/dylanchords/
to have each songs starting on a left-hand side.
